# This is a placeholder for your Firebase service account key.
# 
# To get your service account key:
# 1. Go to Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com)
# 2. Select your project
# 3. Click the gear icon → Project settings
# 4. Go to "Service accounts" tab
# 5. Click "Generate new private key"
# 6. Save the downloaded JSON file here as "service-account.json"
#
# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
# - NEVER commit the actual service-account.json to Git
# - Keep this file secure with restricted permissions
# - If compromised, revoke immediately in Firebase Console
#
# The file should look something like:
# {
#   "type": "service_account",
#   "project_id": "your-project-id",
#   "private_key_id": "...",
#   "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
#   "client_email": "firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
#   "client_id": "...",
#   "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
#   "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
#   "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
#   "client_x509_cert_url": "..."
